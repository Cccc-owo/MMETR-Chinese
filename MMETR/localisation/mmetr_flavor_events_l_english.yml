 mmetrFlavor_JAP.1.t: "Imperial Court Rank Granted"
 mmetrFlavor_JAP.1.desc: "Our prestige has allowed us to petition the Imperial Court to grant us a court rank. Although the Emperor himself does not possess much in the way of political or martial power, the renown carried by possessing a court rank granted to us by the Emperor himself continues to be a symbol of eminence and honor, separating us from all of the other lot who wish to seek glory in this period of uncertainty and chaos."
 mmetrFlavor_JAP.1.a: "Send our thanks to the Emperor."
 
 mmetrFlavor_War.1.t: "Sack of Basra"
 mmetrFlavor_War.1.desc: "The Qarmatians have broken through the walls and gates of Basra - while the Basrans have fought bravely, many have fallen to the Qarmatians. The Qarmatians pillaged the city for days, the defenders of the city have been massacred without mercy, and many of the city's inhabitants have been taken by the Qarmatians as slaves."
 mmetrFlavor_War.1.a: "How horrible!"
 mmetrFlavor_War.1.tt: "Has happened:"
 mmetrFlavor_War.2.t: "Sack of Basra"
 mmetrFlavor_War.2.desc: "After a long siege, we Qarmati have broken through the walls of the opulent city of Basra. The Basrans were no match for our warriors, proving that we truly are backed by God Himself in our revolution against the false Caliphs. Our soldiers have pillaged the city for days, the defenders of the city have been massacred without mercy, and many of the city's inhabitants have been taken by the Qarmatians as slaves."
 mmetrFlavor_War.2.a: "The revolution is unstoppable!"
 
 
 #Government-Related Events
 mmetrFlavor_Governments.1.t: "Election of the Tanist"
 mmetrFlavor_Governments.1.desc: "With the office of the heir, the Tanist, to the throne vacant, the time has come for the various members of the ruling clan to elect the heir of [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] from the roydammna, or 'those of kingly material.'\n\nTraditionally, the Tanist is elected from a member of the ruling dynasty who shares a patrilineal grandfather with the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. Furthermore, tanists must be in good physical condition, have no physical or mental blemishes, and must be of full adulthood. The election of the tanist allows for the balance of power between the various cadet branches of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], though many times the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s eldest son may be chosen if he meets the requirements."
 mmetrFlavor_Governments.1.a: "The prominent head of a cadet branch"
 mmetrFlavor_Governments.1.b: "The youngest head of a cadet branch"
 mmetrFlavor_Governments.1.c: "With age comes wisdom..."
 mmetrFlavor_Governments.1.d: "The eldest son of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis]self"
 mmetrFlavor_Governments.2.t: "Sibling Consort of the Pharaoh"
 mmetrFlavor_Governments.2.desc: "To keep the divine bloodline of our great Pharaoh pure, we continue to uphold the practice of intermarriage within the royal family. Thus, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHisCap] Divine Majesty [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has officially wed [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] sibling in a grand and lavish marriage ceremony in $CAPITAL_CITY$. After the marriage and religious rites were completed, the newlywed couple paraded through the streets of the capital. May their combined wisdom and divine rule through the goddess Ma'at bestow peace and prosperity upon the peoples of the [Root.GetAdjective] Kingdom."
 mmetrFlavor_Governments.2.a: "Till death do us part"
 
 
 #Estate Events
 mmetr_estate_events.1.t: "Holy Orders Enter [Root.GetName]"
 mmetr_estate_events.1.desc: "The various Holy Orders of Christendom are officially recognized by the Church. The Holy Orders partake in charitable services for the poor and downtrodden in times of peace; in times of war, they are a valuable military asset, as their renowned Knights are among the most skilled cavalry in all of the land.\n\nThus, to bring security and prosperity to our lands, we have decided to invite the various Holy Orders of the land to establish a regional headquarters in our lands. We look forward with great optimism to the boon that they shall bring to our land and people."
 mmetr_estate_events.1.a: "We welcome all of the aid they have to offer"
 mmetr_estate_events.2.t: "[Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s Son Sent to Monastery"
 mmetr_estate_events.2.desc: "It is the norm for our dynasty to send members of the royal family to serve as abbots in monasteries. It is also common that extra sons and daughters who could not be married are instead sent to these monasteries so they would not threaten the inheritance of the older children. While the political motives of these actions may tarnish our reputation among our people temporarily, it may be worth doing so to avoid the division of our realm."
 mmetr_estate_events.2.a: "Let us hope this saves us from future troubles."
 mmetr_estate_events.3.t: "Royal Claimant Returns from Monastery!"
 mmetr_estate_events.3.desc: "When the late ruler of [Root.GetName] was still with us, one of their sons had been sent to serve as an abbot in one of the many monasteries under the control of the royal family. While such pious service as an abbot is admirable and well-respected, with some royal family members even being granted sainthood after living a devout life in the monasteries, this son in particular had been sent there primarily to avoid succession issues upon the vacancy of the throne.\n\nUnfortunately, it seems that the fears of the late ruler have come true regardless of this move. Hearing that our new ruler [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has ascended the throne, the forgotten son has now rallied an army of supporters and sympathizers and challenges [Root.Monarch.GetName] for dominion over the [Root.GetAdjective] realm."
 mmetr_estate_events.3.a: "The fool should have stayed in the monastery!"
 
 
 #Religious Events
 
 #Daoism
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.1.t: "Way of the Five Pecks of Rice"
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.1.desc: "A Daoist master by the name of Zhang Ling has founded a new, influential school of Daoism in Shu. Claiming he was visited by Laozi himself, who bestowed upon him the title of Tianshi, or 'Celestial Master,' Zhang Ling has amassed a large number of followers in the region thanks to his focus on health and practices for the purpose of long life.\n\nHis influence is so great that he has founded his own autonomous theocratic state in Shu known as the Way of Five Pecks of Rice, named after the tax levied on his followers - this is likely the most organized form of Daoism in the history of the Middle Kingdom. Should we face more troubled times, we could very well see the widespread diffusion of this sect of Daoism across western and northern China as more become disillusioned with Confucianism and the social harmony promised by Confucius' teachings."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.1.a: "Though inconvenient, a small cult such as this does not threaten us."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.2.t: "Tianshi School Spreads into Hanzhong"
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.2.desc: "The Daoist teachings of the Celestial Masters has spread into Hanzhong, with members of the Way of the Five Pecks of Rice sect follow the Celestial Master into Hanzhong. With the influence of the sect as well as local disatisfaction with the ideals and teachings promoted by our ruling dynasty, many residents of Hanzhong have adopted the practices of the Daoist sect."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.2.a: "Interesting..."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.3.t: "Celestial Masters of Hanzhong"
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.3.desc: "Having entrenched themselves in Hanzhong, the Celestial Masters of the Daoist sect known as the War of Five Pecks of Rice have formed their own organized hierarchy and society in the city. With the Daoists of the city more loyal to the Celestial Master and his teachings than our own government and ruler, our de facto authority in the city is now at threat. While we could persecute the sect, perhaps we could utilize the sect to our advantage and instead win their favor and manpower by officially recognizing their Tianshi Daoist school, which in the process would grant them protected state status."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.3.a: "Officially recognize the Celestial Masters as a legitimate sect."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.3.b: "We cannot allow them to accumulate local power."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.4.t: "Daoism Spreads in [Root.GetName]"
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.4.desc: "Lately, there has been decreased confidence in the state doctrine of Confucianism. While our [Root.Owner.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty has been promoting the teachings of the Sage Confucius, the ineffectiveness of the [Root.Owner.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] dynasty in achieving the harmony promised by Confucius' teachings has caused many to instead turn to Daoism and the teachings of Laozi. As a result, [Root.GetName] has become a center for thriving Daoist schools, and the majority of its cities now believe these schools' understanding of the Dao to be the path to true harmony."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.4.a: "Their lack of faith in us may prove troublesome..."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.5.t: "Heir Interested in Daoism"
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.5.desc: "The instability of our realm has resulted in decreased confidence in Confucianism. Because of thus, an increasing number of intellectuals and officials have turned away from the Confucian ideals sponsored by our state and now favor the philosophy of the Daoists. Confucians and Daoists have shared and exchanged many ideas over the generations, there is no denying that a rivalry still exists between the two schools, especially if supporting one means doubting our divine authority.\n\nRecently, [Root.Heir.GetTitle] [Root.Heir.GetName] has taken an interest in Daoism and surrounded himself with an inner circle of Daoist intellectuals. While it is fair for our heir to take an interest in the various classic schools of thought, allowing [Root.Heir.GetName] to side with the Daoists may potentially undermine the very ideological foundation of our state."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.5.a: "We cannot control the minds of another."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.5.b: "We must purge that which poisons the well!"
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.6.t: "Daoist Alchemist Enters [Root.Capital.GetName]"
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.6.desc: "A Daoist alchemist renowned for his expertise in the natural world has entered our capital - though initially only planning to visit a friend, he has been referred to our court by some capital officials. While his services may be useful to our state, in some cases wise men are best left outside the realm of government, as he like many Daoists likely view our governance as unnatural and thus antithetical to the Dao."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.6.a: "Recruit their services as a member of the court."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.6.b: "Their homeland needs their expertise more than we do."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.7.t: "Daoist Critics"
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.7.desc: "As doubt in the effectiveness of our governance spreads among the populace, so too does the Daoist philosophy, of which many Daoists by nature scrutinize and criticize government institutions. One Daoist text has become especially popular among scholars and other educated groups - while it critiques government institutions as a whole, we have found several instances in which the book implies flaws in our own government and [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. While it is not solid evidence, the palace officials are already considering banning the book's distribution."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.7.a: "They dare question our authority?"
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.7.b: "We must lead by example and avoid tyrannical acts."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.8.t: "Buddhist Monasticism"
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.8.desc: "While Daoism grew popular during Confucianism's decline, another faith that benefited from this trend is Buddhism, with more and more of our people identifying as Buddhists each day. As a result, many of its practices have influenced even followers of Daoism. One of these influences is Buddhist monasticism, as several Neo-Daoists have identified with the values and practices of Buddhist monks.\n\nSome adherants of Daoism have already opted for a monastic lifestyle, constructing monasteries and practicing celibacy, the latter of which is already valued in traditional Daoism as the preservation of qi in one's body. While we have accepted influences from other Schools of Thought in the past, such as Confucianism and Mohism, we view Buddhism as a largely foreign entity, and some Daoist scholars are concerned that accepting too many influences will remove our identity as true Daoists."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.8.a: "Good ideas must be accepted, regardless of where they come from."
 mmetrFlavor_daoism_events.8.b: "We do not need to adopt such practices."
 
 #Waaqism
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.1.t: "Rainfall of Waaq"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.1.desc: "The Supreme Sky God Waaq is our Creator, and He blesses our people in exchange for our faith. Both city dwellers and nomads in Punt pray to Waaq and His celestial mediators, the Ayaanle, so He may bless us with His divine rainfall to water our crops and feed our people. Thus, like many times in the past, His Benevolence Waaq has blessed us with another period of bountiful rain, and our homeland has become more productive than recent years as a result of His generosity."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.1.a: "Glory to Waaq!"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.2.t: "Tomb of Queen Arawelo"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.2.desc: "Queen Arawelo once ruled with an iron fist, favoring a matriarchy in which women of talent were empowered and corrupt men were harshly punished for wrongdoing, and in doing so she established peace and order. Because of her iron grip, she gained the admiration of women but the ire of high-ranking men; when she was attending a funeral, Arawelo was killed by a warlord named Oday Biqay.\n\nToday, the tomb of Arawelo is an important site in our history. Thanks to her now legendary status in our culture and history, many women travel to Arawelo's gravesite to lay flowers; on the other hand, men who pass by the site throw rocks on her tomb. Because of this, a generous noblewoman has sponsored the renovation of the tomb's surroundings."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.2.a: "May Waaq bless her for her kindness."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.3.t: "New Qaalluu Chosen"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.3.desc: "The Qaalluu are the priests of the Supreme God Waaq. As His messengers, the Ayyanle, the celestial angels of Waaq, possess the Qaalluu and speak through them to us mortals. Additionally, the Qaalluu lead the various rituals of our faith as well as uphold the laws of Waaq.\n\nThe Qaalluu are chosen based on their social status and seniority as well as their virtues and leadership qualities. This year, two promising candidates have been favorites for being chosen as a new Qaalluu - one from the influential noble clans, and the other from the wealthy merchant class."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.3.a: "Choose the one with noble blood."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.3.b: "Choose the prominent merchant's son."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.4.t: "Qaallitti Enters the Capital"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.4.desc: "The Qaallitti are female priests of our Supreme God Waaq. They along with their male counterparts the Qaalluu conduct rituals and prayers to the Alaanye, the celestial beings through which we can communicate our needs with Waaq. As upholders of Waaq's divine law, the Qaallitti also represent the best of our people in terms of character and ethics.\n\nRecently, a Qaallitti who recently gained prominence in the countryside for her benevolence, generosity and wisdom has entered our capital seeking an audience with our [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]. We could give her what she requests along with supplies and allow her to return to her home, where she will continue to positively influence the countryside - on the other hand, we could instead offer to recruit her as a court priest so she may provide her religious services and wisdom in the capital."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.4.a: "She will channel the Ayaanle to benefit the country."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.4.b: "She may serve as a proselytizer."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.4.c: "Help her to return to the countryside."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.5.t: "Qaalluu Breaks the Safuu"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.5.desc: "The Qaalluu, the priests of the Waaqi faith, are expected to uphold the Safuu, the moral and legal principles of the Supreme God Waaq. However, one especially-prominent Qaalluu that was previously well-respected by many was caught in an immoral scandal. Many are calling for their resignation from their role as a priest, though the loss of an influential figure would not be ideal for those of the Qaalluu institution who was associated with this scandalous Qaalluu, whose image may be stained in the eyes of the public for quite some time."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.5.a: "They have broken our trust."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.5.b: "We can overlook this."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.6.t: "Qaalluu Partiality in Politics"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.6.desc: "The Qaalluu institution, our priesthood, is expected to remain politically neutral in all cases so that all deliberations and rituals shall be performed with utmost fairness. While it is inevitable that a religious institution shall diffuse into the realm of politics, the Qaalluu are expected to treat both sides equally, except in cases of obvious tyranny.\n\nRecently, an especially prominent Qaalluu overstepped his role, vehemently and passionately defending the actions of one faction in our realm. While impassioned rhetoric would be expected among the noble and merchant classes, such strong bias is unbecoming of the Qaalluu. While not cause for any sort of resignation or exile, it may be our role as temporal leaders to step in and set things straight."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.6.a: "Declare that such open partiality is unacceptable."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.6.b: "He cannot be blamed - we are all human, afterall!"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.7.t: "Waaq Blesses the River"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.7.desc: "Thanks to the prayers and piety of our Qaalluu, the Alaanye, celestial mediators of the Supreme God Waaq, have brought blessings and good luck upon us. One of these blessings is related to our rivers and tributaries, for our soils and fields this season are especially fertile thanks to the benevolence of Waaq."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.7.a: "We humbly thank Waaq for His generosity."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.8.t: "Warding Off Demons in [Root.GetName]"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.8.desc: "The local people of [Root.GetName] have claimed that a terrible demon has been terrorizing them, eating their crops and killing their livestock. They even claim that several villagers have disappeared in the dead of night. Thus, they request that we assist them in warding off these demons by praying to Waaq so He may protect His creations."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.8.a: "May Waaq protect their souls."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.8.b: "They must be hallucinating..."
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.9.t: "Alaanye of Horses"
 mmetrFlavor_waaqism_events.9.desc: "While we are protected by Alaanye, celestial angels who serve and communicate with us on behalf of the Supreme God Waaq, we are not the only ones who are blessed with good luck. It is believed that there are Alaanye for every one of Waaq's creations, which includes animals. Thus, nomads, horse breeders and cavalrymen rely on the Alaanye to bless their horses and return them home safely after travel or battle."

 #Mithraic
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.1.t: "Mithraic Zoroastrianism"
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.1.desc: "Though Zoroastrians have attempted to suppress the cult worship of pre-Zoroastrian gods, the worship of Mithra as a major yazata, or divinity, in Zoroastrianism continues to be popular, especially among certain groups such as nomads and the Parthians. The popularity of Mithra as a divine figure is so great that the Zoroastrians of the Achaemenid period eventually embraced Mithra as the divinity second only to Ahura Mazda, the supreme deity in the Mazdaist Zoroastrianism promoted by the Achaemenids. Thus, the Mithraic religion within our borders is not necessarily a separate faith, but instead a form of Zoroastrianism in which Mithra takes center."
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.1.a: "May Mithra protect both Mazdaists and Mithraists alike."
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.2.t: "Parthian Nobles Favor Mithra"
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.2.desc: "In the traditional domains and homelands of the Parthians, the worship of Mithra as the primary divinity is the most widespread form of worship in the region. Mithra himself has great appeal to the Parthians, as a solar and warrior god on horseback which the Parthian cavalry can most greatly identify with. As a result, the Parthian nobility has as of late been mostly in favor of the Mithraic cult."
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.2.a: "Interesting."
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.3.t: "Followers Construct Mithraeum in [Root.GetName]"
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.3.desc: "A group of wealthy followers of Mithra have constructed a Mithraeum, or Mithraic temple, in [Root.GetName]. This benefits not only the local populace but also our state as a whole, as they have accomplished something that we would otherwise need to spend government funds to build ourselves. Even so, we still have the option to invest some more gold of our own to further expand the Mithraeum."
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.3.a: "May Mithra bless these pious followers."
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.3.b: "Invest some more gold to expand the Mithraeum."
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.4.t: "Cilician Worship of Mithra"
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.4.desc: "Cilicia was once a land dominated by pirates until the pirates were thoroughly routed and dispersed by the famed Pompeius Magnus of Rome. Since the end of Cilician piracy, we have heard reports of secret worship of the eastern god Mithra among the populace. Growing increasingly popular over time, the Mithraic cult has now become widespread in [Root.GetName]."
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.4.a: "Interesting..."
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.5.t: "Generals Join Mithraic Cult"
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.5.desc: "The cult of Mithra has become especially popular among the Roman military, and now some of the highest ranking military officers including some legati have been initiated into the mystery cult. While the cult's practices are mostly performed outside of the public eye, generals who are followers of Mithra notably decline wearing celebratory crowns after successful campaigns, on the basis that they do not wear crowns since their one and only crown is Mithras himself."
 mmetrFlavor_mithraic_events.5.a: "If it makes them fight well on the battlefield..."
