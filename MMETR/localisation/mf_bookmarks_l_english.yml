At the same time, Japan's recent alliance with Great Britain meant that Germany and France would avoid involvement if a conflict between Russia and Japan erupted; therefore, Japan did not have any qualms with starting hostilities against Russia.

However, the Shah interpreted "sultan of the setting sun" as an insult, and thus executed an entire 500-man caravan sent in goodwill by the Khan. The Shah had sealed his own fate.

The two states had fiercely debated over who was the rightful owner of Jing Province, and in 219 the King of Wu, Sun Quan, seized the province and executed the Shu general Guan Yu. Guan Yu was a very close friend to now-Emperor of Shu Liu Bei, and thus the latter promised nothing but destruction for his former ally. While mobilizing against Wu, his close friend and general Zhang Fei was also assassinated, which further fueled the rage of the emperor.
