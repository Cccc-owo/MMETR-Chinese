 #Antiquity
 germanic_empire_ancient_reform: "Germanic Empire"
 germanic_empire_ancient_reform_desc: "Though we invaded the Western Roman Empire and established distinctly Germanic kingdoms, if we wish to continue ruling over stable lands, we will have to learn to accept and integrate the various non-German cultures under our rule. Many of our subjects are former Roman administrators, and are well-versed in governing a centralized state. Thus, we have the opportunity to adopt a more Roman form a government, with a more centralized monarchy in which the state and people serve the king, rather than the other way around."
 
 kemetic_monarchy_reform: "Kemetic Theocratic Monarchy"
 kemetic_monarchy_reform_desc: "Dating back to the very first dynasties of the Old Kingdom of Egypt, the title of Pharaoh was adopted even by the foreign invaders of the Persians and Greeks, with the Hellenistic Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt carrying on this tradition for many generations. The Pharaoh is the reincarnation of Horus himself, serving the people of Egypt as a god on earth and ruling with the divine authority of Ma'at. Because of the ruling dynasty's divine heritage, the bloodline remains pure through the intermarriage of siblings with the pharaoh; while the pharaoh cannot marry members of other families, less important members of the royal family under the Ptolemaic dynasty were permitted to marry with other families for political reasons."
 
 roman_imperium_reform: "Roman Imperium"
 roman_imperium_reform_desc: "During the time of the Republic, imperium referred to the authority for a Roman citizen to lead armies in battle and control the military and government. With the ascension of the Roman Principate, notions of imperium changed, as the Caesar became the sole and absolute authority of the land, with the Senate relegated to the roles of advisors and justices. Thus, the Roman administration is built from the ground up to revolve around the Caesar, and in return the Caesar shall lead both the temporal and religious realms of the empire."
 
 yuezhi_confederation_reform: "Yuezhi Confederation"
 yuezhi_confederation_reform_desc: "Before we Yuezhi settled in the lands of Bactria as kings, our forefathers were a great nomadic confederation and lords of the steppe, once such a powerful force on the steppes that our Yuezhi forefathers even compelled the mighty Xiongnu to bend the knee and pay us tribute. Although it would be difficult to completely return to our ancestral heritage as nomads, we can at least take inspiration from our nomadic forefathers and integrate our ancestral way of life into a kind of hybrid steppe monarchy."
 
 theocratic_monarchy_ancient_reform: "Theocratic Monarchy"
 theocratic_monarchy_ancient_reform_desc: "The country is ruled by a divine monarch who serves as both temporal and religious ruler of their subjects, and only members of their bloodline are considered divinely sanctioned to rule. Thus, to serve the monarch is also to serve one's faith; to question one's monarch is to question one's faith."
 
 judean_monarchy_reform: "Judean Monarchy"
 judean_monarchy_reform_desc: "Modeled after the Herodian monarchy, the ruler is the King of the Jews, the basileus of Judea. Unlike the theocratic Hasmonean dynasty before it, the position of the King is separate from the office of the High Priest, the most notable religious leader in the Temple of Jerusalem. Still, the king possesses much influence over both temporal and religious affairs in the country."
 
 semi_nomadic_empire_reform: "Semi-Nomadic Empire"
 semi_nomadic_empire_reform_desc: "A form of rulership resulting from a nomadic confederation adopting the government and administration of a Chinese empire while still retaining key aspects and traditions of their nomadic culture. Thus, while a Chinese empire in identity, traditions such as mobile capitals and other non-Chinese practices are still practiced by both the noble and ruling classes alike."
 
 chinese_claimant_empire_reform: "Chinese Claimant Empire"
 chinese_claimant_empire_reform_desc: "Although a Celestial Emperor exists who claims to possess the Mandate of Heaven, we dispute their claim and declare that the Mandate instead belongs in our hands. With the proper title of 'Emperor' and a proper imperial administration, there is little that distinguishes us from the nominal Celestial Empire."
 
 parthian_empire_reform: "Parthian Empire"
 parthian_empire_reform_desc: "Having usurped the Seleukid Empire before them in Mesopotamia and Persia, the Parthian kings adopted both Greek and Persian administration and culture. Though ruling over a vast empire, the Parthian rulers preferred a decentralized approach to ruling. Having no standing army, the Parthian king relied on his vassals and commanders to levy troops and wage wars. Furthermore, the Parthian kings, though expansionist, preferred placing local client kings in charge of lands on the periphery, along with smaller satraps in direct territories of the Parthian king."
 
 
 #Medieval
 anglo_saxon_monarchy_reform: "Anglo-Saxon Monarchy"
 anglo_saxon_monarchy_reform_desc: "Anglo-Saxon society is based on reciprocal arrangements between the king, or cyning, and all the lower classes, including the Anglo-Saxon landed nobles, known as ealdormen and thegns, who swear fealty to the king and provide military support. This reciprocal dynamic between king and subject is shown in the Witan, the royal council: the Witan has the right to approve a king's successor, and the king is therefore expected to listen to the council, or redes, of the Witan. In return, the Witan and all subjects of the realm, having chosen their king, have the duty to serve as loyal subjects to their chosen king."
 
 seljuk_sultanate_reform: "Seljuk Sultanate"
 seljuk_sultanate_reform_desc: "Granted the title of 'Sultan' from the Caliph himself, the Seljuks rule over a great empire blending the nomadic Turkic traditions of the Seljuks' ancestors and the systems and administrations of Persian and Arab empires. With the Sultan always on the move with his itinerant court, the Vizier governs the state on behalf of the Sultan as well as oversees the expansive Supreme Diwan, the bureaucracy of the empire."
 
 ayyubid_sultanate_reform: "Ayyubid Sultanate"
 ayyubid_sultanate_reform_desc: "The government established by Saladin, the Ayyubid Sultanate relies on the ideas of family rule and collective sovereignty, as local emirates led by members of the Ayyubid dynasty are charged with administering all corners of the Ayyubid realm. This vast and expanding Ayyubid household, which was not necessarily defined by blood, allowed for a great network of autonomous emirs who are all subordinate to the Sultan. Thus, this form of administration is inextricably linked to the Ayyubid family itself."
 
 iberian_crusader_state: "Iberian Crusader State"
 iberian_crusader_state_desc: "A unique form of monarchy born from the circumstances of the Reconquista, an Iberian Crusader State involves the close cooperation between an Iberian monarch and the various holy orders. As a mutually-beneficial relationship, in which the orders assist in the crusades against the enemies of Christendom and in return are granted land and high positions in government and administration, this connection between the lord and their pious subjects has become inextricable."
 
 latin_empire_monarchy_reform: "Latin Empire"
 latin_empire_monarchy_reform_desc: "The Empire of Constantinople is a hybrid of Western feudalism and some aspects of Byzantine administration. Taking the place of the Byzantines in Constantinople, Latinokratia, or 'Latin rule,' is marked by a Catholic emperor consecrated by the Pope himself; the emperor has a council made up of Frankish and Latin barons as well as the influential Venetian Podesta of Constantinople and his followers. Additionally, various Byzantine aristocrats have also been integrated as lower-ranking vassals and liege-lords in the Latin realm. The various Frankish barons as well as the Venetians possess a great deal of autonomy in the empire in exchange for fealty to the imperial throne."
 
 paternal_monarchy_reform: "Paternal Monarchy"
 paternal_monarchy_reform_desc: "A system of kingship established by King Ramkhamhaeng of the Sukhothai Kingdom. Moving away from Khmer notions of kingship, a form of paternal rule was implemented, in which the king governs his people as if a father would care for his children. The king, rather than using a regal or divine title, was known as 'Pho Khun,' meaning 'Father,' a title that was used by local mueang chiefs. This notion of paternal kingship in turn results in a much more close-knit relationship between king and subject, as the 'children' of the kingdom were in turn granted better treatment and rights under paternal kings."
 
 shaman_monarchy_reform: "Shaman Monarchy"
 shaman_monarchy_reform_desc: "With shamanism being a part of the early Shinto religion of Japan as well as the Ainu and Ryukyuan religions, there are many who follow these faiths who may look upon a shaman or shamaness to lead them. Thus, a Shaman Monarchy is led by a shaman-king or shamaness-queen who leads both temporal and spiritual aspects of society. Ranked below the shaman-king or shamaness-queen are the various officials who serve in temporal roles in administering the country, divided into various ranks and positions."
 
 tanist_monarchy_reform: "Tanist Monarchy"
 tanist_monarchy_reform_desc: "The traditional Gaelic form of monarchy, rather the eldest son inheriting the throne through primogeniture, heirs are elected from among the heads of the various branches of the ruling dynasty. The heir was required to be of full age, be in good physical condition, and not have any physical or mental flaws. This balances power between the various branches of the ruling dynasty, as the election of the tanist often rotated between branches. With so many royal branches expanding in this system, the number of able-bodied warriors able to be recruited by these various branches also increases."
 
 timurid_emirate_reform: "Timurid Emirate"
 timurid_emirate_reform_desc: "Although our founder Timur could never formally adopt the title of Khan because he was not a direct descendant of Genghis Khan, he had adopted the title of Emir of the Genghisids, yet also claimed to be supported by the will of God. Though we have left behind the nomadic nature of our ancestors, our emirate keeps the traditions of the Mongol horde while also maintaining spiritual authority akin to that of a Caliphate; our state is unique in that it holds neither pretension nor arrogance in its titles yet at the same time possesses much actual temporal and religious power."

 samurai_republic_government_reform: "Samurai Republic"
 samurai_republic_government_reform_desc: "Inspired by the federal republic of the United States, the samurai class have established a similar form of government led by a president, known as the Sosai. Suffrage, however, belongs solely to the samurai class, and the government balances modern notions of democracy with old traditions, keeping the traditions of the samurai untouched by any reform. This allows for a prominent military and samurai caste in society even in the absence of a shogunate."
 
 pisan_consulate_reform: "Pisan Consulate"
 pisan_consulate_reform_desc: "We have been granted the authority to elect Consuls by the Emperor himself. As the old nobility and merchant class of our city continue to struggle against one another for authority, the Consulate presents an opportunity for representation of the classes of landed aristocrats as well as merchants and artisans in the government. The Consul himself is elected from the citizens of the city."
 
 pisan_podesteria_reform: "Pisan Podesteria"
 pisan_podesteria_reform_desc: "The bitter struggle between the nobility and merchant class of our city has resulted in the desire for stability and impartiality within our government.

 hunnic_confederation_reform: "Hunnic Confederation"
 hunnic_confederation_reform_desc: "The Huns rule over a large confederation of various different groups, both nomadic and sedentary, and of many different languages. Though disunified when they first entered Europe, their wars of expansion and their clashes with the Roman Empire have allowed the Huns to increasingly centralize power in the hands of the Hunnic king. Furthermore, sub-kings of non-Hunnic cultures as well as logades, or ministers, are also appointed to rule over different parts of the rapidly-expanding Hunnic confederation."

 #Roman
 roman_imperial_cult_t2_reform: "Imperial Cult"
 roman_imperial_cult_t2_reform_desc: "Since Augustus established the Roman Principate, our Imperator reigns as not only a ruler of the temporal realm but also reigns as a god. As a sacred, divine ruler, Roman emperors are deified, and the Roman people must worship the Imperator just as if they were worshipping Jupiter or Mars. Further codification of this institution, such as proskynesis (prostration) and mandatory sacrifices in the name of the Imperator, shall grant even more temporal and religious power to our Imperator and therefore the central government as a whole."
 constitutio_antoniniana_t2_reform: "Constitutio Antoniniana"
 constitutio_antoniniana_t2_reform_desc: "This edict declares that all free men in the Roman Empire are granted full Roman citizenship. Once a prestigious status in the times of the Republic, notions of citizenship have evolved as our empire grew further beyond Latium. With so many foreign cultures under our empire, we must take steps to integrating and appeasing these peoples, even if it may leave pure-blooded Romans dissatisfied. Besides granting a desired status to our subjects, we can now also extract greater amounts of tax revenue from the integrated populations across the empire."
