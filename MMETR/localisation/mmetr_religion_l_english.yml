 daoism: "Daoist"   #adjective for name
 daoism_religion_desc: "Daoism believes that one must live in harmony with the Dao, roughly translated as the 'Way.'

Despite its aversion to man-made institutions, Daoism has nonetheless influenced politics, governance and warfare in states across East Asia since it first emerged among the Chinese schools of thought during the Warring States period."
