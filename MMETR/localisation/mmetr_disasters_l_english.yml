 yellow_turban_rebellion: "Yellow Turban Rebellion"
 desc_yellow_turban_rebellion: "A Taoist sect known as the Way of the Supreme Peace has recently significantly grown in numbers. Its leaders are reknowned healers among all classes of Han society, and their growing influence across the social classes, most significantly the peasant class, is seen as a threat by many in the Han court. Wearing yellow turbans as a symbol of their faith and unity, their members continue to grow in number, and we fear they may one day rise in rebellion against the Han dynasty."
 
 abbasid_fitna: "Abbasid Fitna"
 desc_abbasid_fitna: "Although the Abbasids reign as the official leaders of the Islamic world, the great size, power and influence of our realm is the source of jealously for many in our realm, several of which are scions of the Abbasid dynasty itself. Besides the various relatives of the Caliph, we also faced sectarian resistance from the Kharijites and Alids who live in our borders. Furthermore, the growing influence of the Turkic generals in the Caliphate is also a great source of concern for any ambitious Caliph who wishes to maintain their undisputed authority, with no strings attached, in the Caliphate. Thus, just as the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates have faced, perhaps it may be inevitable that we may one day face a Fitna of our own."
 
 byzantine_anarchy: "Byzantine Anarchy"
 desc_byzantine_anarchy: "It has been long since the glory days of the Roman Empire. The subjects of the Roman Emperor in Constantinople are becoming disillusioned by failed attempts to restore the empire to its former glory, and the loyalty of the soldiers to the Roman Emperor and his aspirations is not guaranteed. Thus, should a notable pretender ever gain enough of a following to openly revolt against the Emperor, such a pretender would surely be only a symptom of the real disorder and unrest that is yet to come."

 desc_fitna_of_al_andalus: "Internal struggles involving members of the Caliphate of Córdoba's ruling dynasty, ambitious viziers, and rebellious governors of frontier divisions along with a variety of other factors have contributed to what many today recognize as the decline of the Caliphate's central authority. Just as was faced by the Rashidun, Umayyads and Abbasids, some officials and scholars foresee a great Fitna, or 'trial,' on the horizon that we of Córdoba shall need to endure."

Though [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.Dynasty.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetName] and the eunuchs of the Imperial capital have tried to ignore the recent movements of the Way of the Supreme Peace, it seems that we can no longer ignore the cries of the struggling peasantry. Having coordinated with other followers of the Daoist sect across the land, the leaders of the Way of the Supreme Peace and their followers have donned yellow scarves atop their heads and raised up arms against the Han dynasty. With countless rebels across the land now wearing yellow scarves, their slogan can be heard echoing across the skies:\n\n'The Azure Sky is already dead; the Yellow Sky will soon rise!\nWhen the year is jiazi, there will be prosperity under Heaven!'"

 yellow_turban_rebellion.4.desc: "A court official and scion of the Han dynasty named Liu Yan has convinced the Emperor that the Yellow Turbans were allowed to organize due to the weak authority of the various Inspectors who govern the provinces of the Han. Thus, in accordance with Liu Yan's suggestions, the imperial court has decided to promote the Inspectors to the rank of Governor, granting them greater autonomy in the farther reaches of the empire for the sake of putting an end to the chaos and unrest caused by the rebellion. With the central power of the Han concentrated in Central Plains, the southern Governors have therefore acquired significant autonomy as administrators of the Han barbarian frontier."

Thus, when the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out, the Administrator of Liaodong, Gongsun Du, used the opportunity to ensure greater autonomy for his realm and appointing himself Governor of Pingzhou. With a great rebellion to deal with, we have little choice but to allow their de facto autonomy from the Han empire for the time being."

Seizing the ancestral Han capital of Luoyang and marching into the capital as the Han Emperor flees, the Yellow Turbans have declared their leader Zhang Jue as Emperor and the new Son of Heaven.\n\nZhang Jue has now declared himself the founder of the new Zhao dynasty, since he and the Zhang brothers were born in Julu Commandery, the ancestral homeland of the Zhao State of the Warring States period.

The Caliph was found dead in the palace, and it is suspected that the assassination was carried out by the Caliph's own Turkic soldiers. It is said that the Caliph and his vizier were eating in the Caliph's personal chambers when the Turkic soldiers attacked. However, as the Turkic generals themselves possess great military influence in the capital, and thus this story has been dismissed as mere rumors - the official story now is that the Caliph had tragically choked to death on his drink."

 abbasid_fitna.2.desc: "The various notable Fitna of history have resulted in the downfall and collapse of both the Rashidun and Umayyad Caliphates that came before us. Although we and our people have suffered greatly, we have successfully endured the Fitna of our times and have brought the Abbasid Caliphate from the brink of destruction. Although there is much work to do in restoring prosperity and order to our realm, the Abbasid dynasty lives on, proving to all that we have passed our great test of faith and are the true and undisputed leaders of Islam."

 abbasid_fitna.3.t: "Mysterious Death of the Caliph"
 abbasid_fitna.3.desc: "As if there were not enough troubles to deal with already, we were shocked to find that the Caliph has mysteriously passed away! With the constant plotting in the court along with the cause of death being so unclear, it is unsurprising that there are many rumors circulating, though many can agree that they are convinced the Caliph was poisoned.\n\nThe influential Turkic generals, now seen as kingmakers by some, have gone ahead with the selection of a new successor. Among the family members, the Turkic generals were able to acquire the choice of heir from the Caliph himself before he passed away. In his deathbed, the Caliph chose..."

 abbasid_fitna.3.c: "...his cousin Al-Musta'in"
 abbasid_fitna.4.t: "Rivals Challenge the Caliph!"
 abbasid_fitna.4.desc: "Although the Turkic generals confirmed our Caliph as the rightful successor following the sudden death of his close relative, the previous Caliph, the other two contenders for the Caliphate are not overjoyed at having been passed over, to say the least. Thus, it seems that the two rivals have both claimed the title of Caliph for themselves, and now they lead an army of loyalists against us as pretenders to the throne."
 abbasid_fitna.4.a: "We shall not give in to the likes of them!"
 abbasid_fitna.5.t: "Rivals Executed!"
 abbasid_fitna.5.desc: "The Abbasid scions who dared raise arms against our Caliph as pretenders to the throne have been utterly defeated in battle. Although they were promised mercy, our Caliph has decided to execute them for their insolence.\n\nThe executioner brought their heads before the Caliph and declared the death of the pretender; however, the Caliph, playing chess, told the executioner 'Lay the heads aside until I have finished my game.'"

 abbasid_fitna.7.desc: "A massive rebellion has broken out among the slaves from the Zanj region of Southeast Africa who had been sold to our markets for use as slave labor in plantations. The working and living conditions of the Zanj slaves were miserable - in hindsight, a rebellion like this should have been anticipated. Joined by several freemen as well as slaves of other cultures who are dissatisfied with Abbasid rule, the Zanj rebels have inspired slave rebellions across the realm."

 abbasid_fitna.10.t: "Kharijite Rebellion"
 abbasid_fitna.10.desc: "A regional dispute between a local dihqan and the administrators of the region has quickly escalated into a large-scale revolt of Kharijites, a militant Islamic sect that originated from supporters of Ali in the First Fitna. The Kharijites have pledged allegiance to this dihqan and have taken up arms against Abbasid rule across the realm. The rebels have already slain several hundred local Abbasid troops that were dispatched to deal with the revolt. Thus, it seems that this shall be a much greater challenge than we had originally anticipated."

 abbasid_fitna.11.t: "Kharijite Rebel Leader Humiliated"
 abbasid_fitna.11.desc: "The rebel leaders of the Kharijite Rebellion have all been captured or killed, and the army commanders who saw success in battle against the rebels have been properly rewarded with robes of honor. Donning the robes, our generals rode in triumph throughout our capital of $CAPITAL_CITY$, and behind them trailed the captured rebel leaders. The commander of the rebels was placed atop an elephant in a woman's litter and was forced to wear humiliating clothing. Fortunately for him, his humiliation would not last very long, for the rebel commander and his subordinates were shortly after put to death by crucifixion."
 abbasid_fitna.11.a: "Let us hope this peace lasts"
 abbasid_fitna.12.t: "Advisor Assassinated!"
 abbasid_fitna.12.desc: "A trusted advisor of our Caliph has been mysteriously assassinated! With so many rival factions within and against the Caliphate, we are unsure of who to blame for their death. A longtime ally and confidant of our Caliph, there are many who mourn their death and the loss of their wisdom - though perhaps there are just as many who are secretly in celebration."

Many of the governors in the frontier provinces express doubt regarding [Root.Monarch.GetName]’s rule, and various members of even the ruling Umayyad dynasty in Córdoba have voiced opposition to [Root.Monarch.GetHerHim], whether it be out of genuine concern for the state or due to their own treasonous ambitions.\n\nAs a result, the influential Muhammad II al-Mahdi of the ruling Umayyad dynasty has led a revolt against our Caliph, rallying his personal troops as well as other discontent officers and commoners to his cause. While we must do what we can to quash his ambitions, we must also keep in mind that this rebellion is merely a symptom of the Caliphate of Córdoba’s current fragile state. Thus, a greater trial, or fitna, may appear before us in the near future - when it does, we must fight the preserve the security and prosperity of Córdoba and its people."

A close confidant and advisor of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] fell sick with an unknown illness just one night ago - we have now received word that the advisor has died.\n\nWith such a sudden death, most believe it to have been poison of some sort. Perhaps by a secret enemy of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle], or perhaps by other advisors who grew jealous of the confidant's favor with [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].

Acquiring loyal and private armies of their own, these governors may lead armies against us in the future in the hopes of carving out their own realms in al-Andalus.

Thus, Pepin of the Carolingians is the Mayor no more, for Pepin gained the authority to move against [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName].\n\nWith the magnates of the land almost all unanimously supporting the Mayor and few loyal troops to the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s name, [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] [Root.Monarch.GetName] has little choice but to step down and live the rest of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] life in obscurity, confined to a monastery far from the capital; [Root.Monarch.GetName] shall subsequently be tonsured, [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] long hair which once symbolized [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] right to rule being cut."
