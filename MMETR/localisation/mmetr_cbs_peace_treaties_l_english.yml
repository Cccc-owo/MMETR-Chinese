 cb_conclude_civil_war_desc: "Our realm, once united, is now divided in a period of civil war. Both sides of the civil war wish to put an end to the disunity and unite all of the land under one ruling power once more. With this casus belli, we can fully annex our enemy - on the other hand, they shall have the same justification to do the same to us should we lose."
