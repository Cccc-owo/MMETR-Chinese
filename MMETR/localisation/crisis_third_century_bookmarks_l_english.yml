 GALLIC_EMPIRE_BOOKMARK_NAME: "The Gallic Empire"
 GALLIC_EMPIRE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "The Roman Empire has been divided. Faced by what is now called the Crisis of the Third Century, Rome is plagued by a string of internal revolts and short-lived tyrants. In 260 AD, the Roman emperor Valerian is defeated and captured by the Sassanid king of kings Shapur I - that very same year, the Roman governor Postumus gains de facto control of the lands of Gaul, and by 261 AD the cities of Britannia and Hispania recognized him as the true Roman emperor, rejecting the rule of Gallienus, son of the captive Valerian. Emperor Postumus declares himself Restitutor Galliarum, or 'Restorer of Gaul,' and establishes a Roman government much like the one in Rome, with consuls, a senate and a praetorian guard. In the east, Odaenathus, the archon of Palmyra, wins autonomy from both Rome and Persia, establishing the Kingdom of Palmyra."
 PALMYRENE_EMPIRE_BOOKMARK_NAME: "Queen of Palmyra"
 PALMYRENE_EMPIRE_BOOKMARK_DESC: "While the Gallic Empire reigns in the far western reaches of the Roman Empire, in the east Queen Zenobia of Palmyra rules as regent on behalf of her son Vaballathus, succeeding her late husband Odaenathus as the de facto ruler of Palmyra. Before long, the kingdom of Palmyra expands into a vast empire, seizing the lands of Egypt, Syria and central Anatolia, and the great Queen Zenobia reigns over notable cities such as Alexandria, Antiochia and Ancyra. Though nominally swearing allegiance to the Roman Emperor, it would not be long before Zenobia declared her son Emperor, and thus herself Empress as his regent. Although Rome was forced to abandon the lands of Dacia, which soon fell under the control of the Goths, in Rome now reigns the capable Emperor Aurelian. Aurelian seeks to reunite the Roman Empire and restore peace and stability to his Roman Empire."
