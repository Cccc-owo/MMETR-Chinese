 mmetr_form_ancient_macedonia_nation_title: "Restore Macedonia"
 mmetr_form_ancient_macedonia_nation_desc: "Many years ago, the Kingdom of Macedonia rose to prominence under Philippos II and expanded into a great empire during the reign of his son Alexandros III, also known as Alexander the Great. However, over a century after the empire's height, the Macedonian kingdom was destroyed by the Roman Republic and later integrated as a province of the Roman Empire. However, the Macedonian peoples still long for the day when their cultural identity shall rule a kingdom of their own once more. Thus, should we ever seize the historic Macedonian capital of Pella, we would be able to restore the Macedonian state."
 
 english_anglo_saxon_nation_title: "Form Anglo-Saxon England"
 english_anglo_saxon_nation_desc: "Long ago, our Angle, Saxon and Jute forefathers arrived on the shores of Britannia and conquered its lands from the weak Britons who were spoiled by Roman protection and undeserving of being its rulers. Our ancestors established separate kingdoms across the land, each with its own throne and traditions. Thus, with the unification of the Anglo-Saxon people under our rule, we would be able to declare a united crown of the Anglo-Saxons as rulers of a new state of England."
 holy_oriental_empire_nation_title: "Declare the Sacrum Imperium Orientale"
 holy_oriental_empire_nation_desc: "Although the Eastern Roman Empire had been an ally of the Church in the past, the city of Constantinople is now under threat from heathen invaders. Thus, we must defend the faith by staking direct claim to both the Holy Land and the City of the World's Desire, becoming the successor to the Basileus of the Eastern Romans with the declaration of a new Holy Oriental Empire." 
 dual_monarchy_england_nation_title: "Form the Dual Monarchy"
 dual_monarchy_england_nation_desc: "There have been several opportunities in the past for the English and French thrones to be united under a single monarch, although all progress towards this goal in the past was only temporary. Should we ever unite the two crowns of England and France and, furthermore, fully consolidate our authority as permanent rulers of the two realms, we would be able declare the official and permanent establishment of the Dual Monarchy in England and France."
 dual_monarchy_france_nation_title: "Form the Dual Monarchy"
 dual_monarchy_france_nation_desc: "There have been several opportunities in the past for the English and French thrones to be united under a single monarch, although all progress towards this goal in the past was only temporary. Should we ever unite the two crowns of England and France and, furthermore, fully consolidate our authority as permanent rulers of the two realms, we would be able declare the official and permanent establishment of the Dual Monarchy in England and France."
 north_german_federation_nation_title: "Form the North German Federation"
 north_german_federation_nation_desc: "For countless generations, the North German peoples have been divided between numerous polities. To promote the unification of the German peoples under our banner, we would benefit from the declaration of a great North German Confederation. Although it is a confederation of allied states and countries in name, in practice it shall function as a federation, with our state as the unspoken yet undisputed leader of the Confederation."
 
 austria_hungary_nation_title: "Form Austria-Hungary"
 austria_hungary_nation_desc: "In this uncertain era of rising nationalism, we must make compromises to ensure the survival of our multiethnic empire. Long has the Austrian crown ruled over its various non-Austrian subjects. However, these subjects demand more and more from our government, and we fear they may one day demand full independence from the Austrian state. Thus, we could establish a dual monarchy in which the Kingdom of Hungary is restored as a union partner with the Kingdom of Austria. Though they would have separate and autonomous administrations, the crowns of Austria and Hungary would both remain subservient to the ruler of the Austrian empire, who would adopt the new title of Emperor-King, being both King of Austria and Emperor of the entire state."
 
 
 #Middle East / Islamic World
 saudi_arabia_formable_nation_title: "Form Saudi Arabia"
 saudi_arabia_formable_nation_desc: "The Sa'ud dynasty has held much power and influence in the lands of Arabia. Since the decline of the last Arabian Caliphate, the heartland of Arabia was divided between competing tribes, emirates, sheikdoms and sultanates, and Arabia has not known true unity under Arab rule since then. Thus, should the Arab heartlands be united under our dynasty, most notably the holy lands of Hejaz, we would have the authority, power and legitimacy to declare the establishment of a united Arabian state under the house of Sa'ud."
 sultanate_of_italiya_nation_title: "Declare the Sultanate of Italy"
 sultanate_of_italiya_nation_desc: "With the establishment of the wealthy Emirates of Sicily as well as those of Bari and Crete, the Muslim community expanded far into the Christian realms of the Mediterranean and into Italy, the homeland of the Romans themselves. Thus, should we vanquish the heathens of Rome and establish a permanent and centralized state across all of Italy, we would be able to official declare a new title never before seen in all of the Islamic world, the title of Sultan of Italiya."
 persian_zoroastrian_nation_title: "Restore the Persian Empire"
 persian_zoroastrian_nation_desc: "Since the fall of the Achaemenid Persian Empire to Alexander the Great, there has never truly been a proper Persian empire to take its place. By uniting key cities across the lands of Greater Persia, we would be able to claim legitimacy to the vacant Persian throne and declare ourselves the new King of Kings of Persia."
 
 almohad_caliphate_formable_nation_title: "Adopt the Banner of the Almohad Caliphate"
 almohad_caliphate_formable_nation_desc: "Although we rule over the far western lands of the Maghrib, we Almohads possess much greater authority, with our universal authority as Caliphs of the Islamic World extending far beyond the lands of Morocco. Thus, to display the might and righteousness of our Caliphate, let us adopt a new banner representing the values and accomplishments of our Almohad Caliphate."

 #India
 mmetr_form_tamilakam_nation_title: "Unite Tamilakam"
 mmetr_form_tamilakam_nation_desc: "The lands of the Tamil have long enjoyed autonomy from the various Indian empires that have ruled the north as well as the Deccan. While the Tamil kings have thrived independent of the northern empires thanks to the lucrative spice trade, the lands of Tamilakam have never known true unity. Thus, should we ever rule over all of Tamilakam proper, we would be able to declare the unification of the Tamil under a single crown of Tamilakam!"
 
 #Americas
 gran_colombia_nation_title: "Form Gran Colombia"
 gran_colombia_nation_desc: "By uniting the former lands of New Granada and centralizing the authority of state, we can establish a powerful nation of Colombia united by geography, culture and heritage. Even if our rivals may not recognize the establishment of our new state of Gran Colombia, we shall do all we can to make it impossible for them to deny the greatness, unity and strength of our Gran Unión."

 united_kingdom_nation_title: "Declare the United Kingdom"
 united_kingdom_nation_desc: "With the crowns of Great Britain and Ireland united under a single British monarch, we can officially declare the Union of the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland. This also means the merger of both parliaments into a single Parliament of the United Kingdom."
 formed_united_kingdom_flag.tt: "No country has formed the United Kingdom"
 
 latin_empire_nation_title: "Declare the Latin Empire"
 latin_empire_nation_desc: "Although seizing the City of the World's Desire would earn us some recognition among many Catholics as the legitimate successor of the Romans in Constantinople, we would not be able to truly claim the legacy of the empire unless we expand our borders to control many of the Eastern Roman Empire's former territories. Thus, should we control key cities across the former Eastern Roman realm, we would be able to declare the true establishment of a great Latin Empire in the east!"
 
 tara_kingdom_nation_title: "Form the Kingship of Tara"
 tara_kingdom_nation_desc: "The title of King of Tara is a prestigious title held by many great Irish kings across generations in the Irish annals of kings and legends. Should we expand our realm and renown as well as acquire the royal seat of the kingship, the Hill of Tara in Meath, we would be able to officially declare the continuation of the kingship of Tara through our own ruling dynasty."

 release_british_east_india_company_decision_title: "Grant Autonomy to the East India Company"
 release_british_east_india_company_decision_desc: "With the East India Company having established a firm foothold in the Indian subcontinent, we now have the opportunity to grant the company autonomy in administering their British lands in India. This would mean effectively releasing them as a trade company subject that can raise their own armies, pursue their own diplomacy, and even wage their own wars at their own discretion. With India being such as vast realm, perhaps it would be wise for us to allow for indirect rule by placing the company in charge of the land."

 mmetr_formable_events.1.t: "The Banner of the Almohads"
 mmetr_formable_events.1.desc: "To display to all that our Caliph is guided by God Himself, we have adopted a new banner representing our Caliphate as well as its lands and peoples.\n\nThe chessboard is a notable symbol in the Islamic World representing verbal sparring - thus, the chessboard on our flag symbolizes the victory of Islam's theological arguments over other heathen religions that have challenged Islam in Andalusia and the Maghreb.\n\nThe name of our dynasty 'Almohad' itself derives from 'al-Muwahhidun,' meaing 'one who affirms the unity of God.' Our identity is therefore inextricably linked to the idea of promoting our doctrine as the sole true doctrine of the universe."
