 estate_eunuchs: "Eunuchs"
 estate_eunuchs_desc: "Highly trusted by the royal family due to their inability to have offspring, the eunuchs take care of the royal household. However, due to their close ties with the royalty, they hold great influence in the court, and may even override the court officials themselves. Thus, it is important for our lord to place trust in virtuous eunuchs while limiting the power of more ambitious eunuch factions in the court."

 estate_eunuchs_noble_titles: "Eunuch Noble Titles"
 estate_eunuchs_noble_titles_desc: "Though the eunuchs are not noble-born, they may be granted noble titles for exceptional service - or perhaps through more unscrupulous means.

 estate_holy_orders_letters_of_credit: "Letters of Credit"
 estate_holy_orders_letters_of_credit_desc: "Some of the holy orders such as the Knights Templar have been known for issuing letters of credit to pilgrims journeying to the Holy Land, after which they would receive their promised funds upon arriving in the Holy Land.
