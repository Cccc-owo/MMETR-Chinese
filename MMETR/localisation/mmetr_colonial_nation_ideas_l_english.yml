 SPA_new_spain_adelantados:0 "Adelantados" 
 SPA_new_spain_adelantados_desc:0 "Granted to Spanish nobles during the Middle Ages, the title has since been extended to conquistadores, granting them the right to act as governors of the lands they conquer in exchange for funding the colonization projects themselves on behalf of the Crown. Although this gives the conquistadores a greater degree of autonomy from our direct command, this allows us to organize additional expeditions of conquest without being limited by our state's finite resources."
 SPA_new_spain_encomiendas:0 "Encomiendas" 
 SPA_new_spain_encomiendas_desc:0 "Originating from the Reconquista in the mother peninsula, conquistadores and notable figures in our society are granted groups of indigenous peoples for labor in return for their services, as well as providing protection for and the conversion of these natives to the Christian faith. In return, the natives provide tribute in the form of metals or livestock and agricultural products."  
 SPA_new_spain_casta:0 "Castas"
 SPA_new_spain_casta_desc:0 "As those of pure Spanish blood intermingle with the indigenous population of our state, many have attempted to make sense of this by creating social classifications based on unions between Spaniards, natives and Africans.

 SPA_new_spain_mexican_inquisition:0 "Mexican Inquisition"
 SPA_new_spain_mexican_inquisition_desc:0 "The Spanish Inquistion is not limited to the physical boundaries of Spain. By the authority of the Pope himself, it is our mission to not only evangelize the natives but also crack down on any practitioners of heresy in our colonial territories.

 SPA_new_spain_pan_oceanic_trade:0 "Pan-Oceanic Trade"
 SPA_new_spain_pan_oceanic_trade_desc:0 "Although the mercantilist policies of our mother nation place a limit on where our gold and goods circulate, being part of a greater global empire surely has its merits; the web of colonies across the globe allows us to trade across the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans and tap into the exotic markets of Asia and Africa, regions that would be typically inaccessable without the aid of our mother empire."

 SPA_spanish_peru_spanish_officers:0 "Spanish Officers"
 SPA_spanish_peru_spanish_officers_desc:0 "Due to Peru's great economic value, the Crown has established a much larger military presence here than anywhere else in the empire.

 SPA_california_presidios:0 "Presidios"
 SPA_california_presidios_desc:0 "Founded simultaneously alongside the missions, presidios serve to protect the colonists, friars and natives who reside in our lands.

 SPA_california_gente_de_razon:0 "Gente de Razón"
 SPA_california_gente_de_razon_desc:0 "We 'people of reason' - the padres, Spaniards, and Californios of mixed Spaniard descent - represent the superiority of Western civilization and the Catholicism.

 GBR_thirteen_colonies_provincial_troops:0 "Provincial Troops"
 GBR_thirteen_colonies_provincial_troops_desc:0 "Civilian militias are rarely used in war besides service in Rangers regiments; instead, provincial troops are raised for extended periods of time as a full-time army.
