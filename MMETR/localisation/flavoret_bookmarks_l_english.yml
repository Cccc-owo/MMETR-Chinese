 FALL_OF_AYUTTHAYA_NAME: "The Fall of Ayutthaya"
 FALL_OF_AYUTTHAYA_DESC: "The great Burmese Empire of the Konbaung dynasty invades Ayutthaya and sacks their capital, leaving Ayutthaya in ruins. However, the looming Qing Empire invades Burma from the north over a border dispute, prompting the victorious armies of King Hsinbyushin to retreat in order to defend their homeland from the Chinese invasion. In the chaos, the Thai general Phraya Taksin escapes from Ayutthaya and names himself King of Siam; he establishes a new capital in Thonburi with the ambitions of reuniting the fractured Thai kingdom, which has fractured into five rival Thai states, one of which is the last remaining Prince of Ayutthaya. Meanwhile, the Taungu Empire fends off the invading armies of the Qing. In Ha Tien, a city at the easternmost tip of the Mekong Delta, the Cantonese merchant Mok dynasty had successfully rebelled against Khmer, establishing an independent Chinese merchant dynasty in Indochina" 
 
 MONGOL_UNIFICATION_WAR_NAME: "Mongol War of Unification"
 MONGOL_UNIFICATION_WAR_DESC: "Temujin, who would later be known as Genghis Khan, is a controversial figure among the Mongol tribes who fear that his meritocratic system will usurp the authority of the Mongol nobles. Thus, various tribes including the Tayichiud, one of the three core tribes of the Khamag Mongol confederation, elect Jamukha as the Gur Khan, the 'universal ruler.' This move is as political as much as it is personal: Jamukha had known Genghis since childhood and was his anda, or blood brother. Representing the status quo of noble authority, Jamukha leads a coalition against his blood brother Temujin in a bid for becoming the Khan of a united Mongol state. Jamukha allies with the powerful Naimans, while Temujin allies with the Kereit ruler Ong Khan, who was the blood brother of Temujin's father Yesugei; thus, this bitter war of blood brothers shall spill blood upon the Mongol steppe one last time."

With Nobunaga's dreams of one day uniting all of Japan under his clan shattered by the treacherous blade of Akechi Mitsuhide, who shall be the one to take up his dream and unite all of Japan?"
